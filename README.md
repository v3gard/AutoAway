# AutoAway
An application that tracks your keyboard presses and mouse movement in order detect whether or not you are AFK.

If you are AFK, AutoAway lets you:

1. Do neat stuff like publishing your away status to a web page using a HTTP POST or
2. Running console commands. This is useful if you need to kill an enterprise application with a license restriction on active users.

AutoAway is licensed under GPL. Hack away!
